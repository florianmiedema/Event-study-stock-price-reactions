This Stata script examines the effect of ex-ministers joining public firms in six major European countries between 1990-2020. By estimating the magnitude of the relationship between a firmâ€™s stock price and the appointment of a former minister, this study shows the extent to which political connections are valued by the market and whether investors acknowledge the potential political inside information and social network that the arrival of a former minister adds to the firm. This Stata script was used for my MSc Finance thesis, which was rewarded with an 8.
